👋  &nbsp;&nbsp; Heyyo, I'm Slesa!

💻  &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a Computer Scientist / Software Developer.

🛠️  &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm currently working with the [IMPACT](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/) team under [NASA's ESDS program](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds).
At IMPACT, I work with various Earth Science 🌎 data, products and algorithms.

🎨  &nbsp;&nbsp; I like making comics 💭, animations 🎭, digital/traditional painting 🖍️; all kind of art, really. See some of my stuff [@saanostory](https://www.instagram.com/saanostory/).
